What is an API?
- API are mechanism that enable two software components-such as the frontend and backend of an application - to communicate with each other using a defined set of rules , protocols , and data formats.It is nothing but a connector.

Why API?
- If i have only one applcation but i want to make for android , ihpone , web then all these application uses different language or different architechture so , if we use API then API -> backend -> database is enough for all the application . If we want a frontend then frontend will interact with API and then from that API it interact with backend and database rather then using application independently.

ML Perspective of API.
- In the case of software the common is database but in the case of ML the common is ML/DL model. Same nai ho but instead of database there is model where backend interact with model and api interact with API and services is given by API.
